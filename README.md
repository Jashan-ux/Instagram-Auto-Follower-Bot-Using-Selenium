# Instagram-Auto-Follower-Bot-Using-Selenium
This project is a Python-based automation tool designed to help you follow Instagram users quickly and efficiently. Using the Selenium library, the bot automates the process of logging into your Instagram account, visiting the profile of another user, opening their followers list, and clicking the "Follow" button for users.
